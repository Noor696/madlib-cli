**About LAB:**

"Mad Libs game contain short stories with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a category, such as noun, verb, place, celebrity, exclamation or part of the body. One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually a sentence which is comical, surreal and takes on somewhat of a nonsensical tone."
